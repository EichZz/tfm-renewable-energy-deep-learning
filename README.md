# Héctor A. Moreno Martín - Deep Learning Algorythms applied to Renewable Energy

## Data selected:
- The data selected represents the measurements of solar power produced by a photovoltaic solar system by minute, and by 30 minutes, for a year, using real data from 2015 and 2016.
- The result is that we have 4 different datasets to work with, each of them with the same type of data, but distributed in different ways and collected in different years.

## Algorythms and methodology used:
- For this research, the methodology used will be deep learning algorythms, an extense field where we can find a predictive model that could suit well this type of data.
- The algorythms selected are:
  · LSTM.
  · GRU.
  · TCN.

## Results.
In first instance, each algorythm will be compared with itself using the 4 different datasets: 1 min - 2015, 1 min - 2016, 30 min - 2015, and 30 min - 2016.
Later, all the algorythms will be compared between them, giving as the result, what algorythm has given better results for this type of data.
